Meeting Log for 11//28

We started this meeting with a scrum where we discussed a lot of changes
that happened to the site as a result of people working during break. In
general there were several updates to the home page to simplify/streamline
the matching process. Database design from the pervious milestone was largely
implemented. 

Additionally we discussed more potential aspects of the website that we would like
to implement before we're done. These included: static resource page with CU links, 
new error redirect, and the stretch goal on in-site messaging.
