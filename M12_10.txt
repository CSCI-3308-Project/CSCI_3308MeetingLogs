Meeting Log 12/10

We went over the presentation and assigned roles for the impending presentation 
this Wednesday. In general we decided that the presentation slides would be divided
equally and that Justin + Pari would lead the demo.

We also decided to try to deploy the application in Heroku such that people 
in lecture during the presentation could log into the website and drive it around.
