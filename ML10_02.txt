Team Meeting 10/2
12pm - 2pm

Spoke more on the specifics of our project such as acutal implementation of architecture and website features. 

We spoke upon the basic landing scheme on our website: 
This is as follows: 
When one first lands on our website, 
it will ask the user if they already have an account with us. 
Then, the user will be presented with a sign-up page if they are not already a member. 
The sign-up page will prompt the user for their @colorado.edu email, for a username, and optional information such as first name, 
last name, graduation year, and their common study location. 
After signing up, 
users will have the  ability to customize their profiles to their liking. 
Users will be able to decide then if they wish to meet up with someone and do partner work or 
meet up with a group and do group work for their respective classes. 

We also spoke upon risk mitigation and how our group was going to do this. We decided 
that we would have to study the respective languages required to finish our project 
outside of class as well. This will hone our skills and allow us to finish on time.
