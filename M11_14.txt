Meeting for 11/14 

With the deadline for Milestone 4 approaching, we discussed further implementation of our database. We decided
that we should add a second table to handle the search information for users.

In general, this table contains volatile data tied to the current users cookie because their search data
doesn't need to be saved on subsequent logins to StuddyBuddies. This table contains names and class (as a minimum).

UI features that support this database will be a 'class filtering' system where users narrow their views of 
potential study buddies by CU CS class.
