Team Meeting 10/10
12 - 2pm

We delegated the specific tasks that each person would get in completing our assignment. 

This allowed us to understanding what exactly we were trying to accomplish and thus gave us an idea of a timeline. 
Thus, we made a timeline where we knew what each individual had to complete. 

Additionally, we also went over what we would do before we met next, and 
talked about what we did before we met for this day. 
This included practicing HTML, node.JS and react over the weekend. 
We found out what exactly each person was lacking in, and we 
are working on this.
