Meeting Log 12/5/17

The focus for this meeting was on last minute features that should 
be added to the project build before it is ready to launch. This included
a resources page, database updates, and a last ditch effort to get in site messaging 
into place. 

Additionally a large part of the meeting was setting up the template for the powerpoint 
presentation to be shown to th class for Milestone 6.
