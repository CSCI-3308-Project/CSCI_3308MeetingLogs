Meeting 10/31

We discussed the repository branch system and how we should avoid redoing each others's work moving forward. 

Furthermore, we discussed the way that we are going to launch the website for the final project presentation, local
on a single system vs cloud hosted. We decidded for the purposes of this project, particularly with our database interaction,
that a local launch would be more in scope. This will allow us to focus more on otehr aspects of the site. 

Finally, we addressed progress on assigned tasks from the previous week. Largely this is still taking the form of individual research rather than 
tangible deliverables.
