When one first lands on our website, it will ask the user if they already have an account with us. Then, the user will be presented with a sign-up page if they are not already a member. The sign-up page will prompt the user for their @colorado.edu email, for a username, and optional information such as first name, last name, graduation year, and their common study location. After signing up, users will have the  ability to customize their profiles to their liking. Users will be able to decide then if they wish to meet up with someone and do partner work or meet up with a group and do group work for their respective classes.

Delegation of tasks based on previous learning and individual skills of our group members will allow us to mitigate our risks. Furthermore, we can learn the respective languages needed to complete this project outside of class, which will further learning and allow us to mitigate the risk of not being proficient with the respective languages for this project. Additionally, we can always subtract and/or add features to the website to allow us to wisely use our time but still meet the project requirements in order to mitigate the risk of not finishing on time.
