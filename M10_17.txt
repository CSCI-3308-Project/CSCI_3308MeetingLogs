Team Meeting 10/17
12 - 2pm

We went over what objectives each person in our team would do to further our understanding of react
and thus add to the login page that we are working on. 
Then, we worked on Milestone 2 and did a sprint meeting. 

Afterwards, we saw the progress that some of our group memebers had made. 
This involved the group seeing and anazlying react code that allowed us to create a login page. 
We have realized that we are making great progress in learning react and thus 
see that it was a wise choice in choosing to use it for our project. 

Finally, we set a time for completion for Milestone 2 and divided up the 
work that each person would do to complete it in a timely manner. This 
allowed us to realize that our team is well organized and that everyone 
is doing their fair share of work to complete thee assignments that 
we have for our project.
